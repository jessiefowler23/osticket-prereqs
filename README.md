I had to create a virtual machine on the computer on Azure first before I could begin working with the OsTicket. I then had to obtain an IP address, which required me to begin the OsTicket process on the remote desktop.

Then i had to launch a web browser on the remote desktop after being able to sign into it. I had to download the files and create the accounts that were required for this operation. I then had to launch PHP as an administrator and register a fresh PHP version for OsTicket to be installed.

The standard help desk account was up next. Then, to connect to the server and communicate with OsTicket, I had to download and install hediSQL. To apply the OsTicket to the default helpdesk account that I am generating, I then had to create a new database for it. on which I was able to install OSTicket and log in.

After completing all the requirements, I was able to access OsTicket using the default account that was created.
